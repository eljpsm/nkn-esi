/**
 * A cryptographic message signature.
 *
 * A message signature is an AES encrypted SHA-256 message digest followed by
 * a SHA-256 ECDSA signature of that digest. The AES encryption key is derived
 * from the public EC key of the recipient and the public and private keys of 
 * the sender, all hashed as a SHA-256 key. The ECDSA signature is signed with
 * the private key of the sender. Thus the sender and recipient must have
 * previously exchanged their public keys.
 *
 * The message data used in the digest and signature is defined by the message
 * this signature is included with. The encompassing message must define what
 * message properties are required.
