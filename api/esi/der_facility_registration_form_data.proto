  // The facility ID must be unique at least within the domain represented by

  // This ID is defined externally to this API. If a facility is directly
  // connected to an exchange, the facility might generate its own unique ID,
  // for example as a UUID. If a facility sits behind a proxy or aggregator
  // service, then the proxy or aggregator service might be responsible for
  // generating unique IDs. In that case, this facility must provide some
  // external method of obtaining its ID from that service. For example, when an
  // EV charger first boots it might come pre-configured to register itself with
  // a proxy service, or prompt for registration with a proxy service; either
  // way it obtains its facility ID which is then passed to the exchange here.
  //
  // Note that the MessageSignature of the route must include the 
  // `facility_endpoint_uri` UTF-8 bytes and `facility_nonce` values. The 
  // recipient's public key should already have been obtained by the facility,
  // and the facility's public key is included in this message.
